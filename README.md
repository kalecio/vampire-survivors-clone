# Vampire Survivors Clone

This is my first experience with gamedev, I've choose to learn godot because the language is pretty similar with python which I have some expertise.

This project can be imported in godot, you can take a look at it running [here](https://kalecio.itch.io/vampire-survivors-clone)
